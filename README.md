>All Packages are going through a reformat, there is a new system being implemented called ```Service Package Manager``` and ```PackageManager```, these will two package managers will allow for better control for each package from outside and inside the game. 

>Its a little more extensive than anything I've previously done on CommandHelper, but my plan is to expand the iCommands across the board with as many useful commands and some command replacements that will give additional information to the users mainly when they lack the required permissions to use said command/s.
## Packages:
