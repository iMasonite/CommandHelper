## ----- CommandHelper - VariableTriggers Bridge ---------------------------------------------
## Various commands targeted for use with VariableTriggers 
## in a PVP arena based environment, they use the permission
## check vt.admin. More information pending. As the VariableTriggers
## plug-in is limited on what you can do, these commands will pick up
## the slack. such as setting a walk/click trigger to
## execute these commands and complete tasks that VariableTriggers 
## cant do very well.
