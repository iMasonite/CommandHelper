###*PVP Environment Commands*

<p><strong>CommandHelper - VariableTriggers Bridge</strong></p>
<p>Various commands targeted for use with VariableTriggers 
in a PVP arena based environment, they use the permission check 
<code>vt.admin</code>. And for the most part are run from Console.</p>

<p>As the VariableTriggers 
plug-in is limited on what you can do, these commands will pick up 
the slack. such as setting a walk/click trigger to execute these 
commands and complete tasks that VariableTriggers cant do very well.</p>

####  Usage:
* Commands:
	* Anti Flee effects: ```/vpvp <player> antiflee```
        * Example: ```/vtwalk @CMDCON runalias vpvp <playername> antiflee```
